## Version Control

This folder documents how Git and GitHub were used to manage version control for this assignment.

### Git Commands Used:

- `git init` – Initialized a local Git repository in the `portfolio` folder.
- `git remote add origin [URL]` – Linked the local repository to a remote GitHub repository.
- `git add .` – Staged all changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"` – Committed the staged files with a message.
- `git push -u origin master` – Pushed local commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull` – Pulled any updates from the remote repository.
- `git branch -m main` – Renamed default branch from master to main (optional).
- `git clone [URL]` – Used to copy a remote repository locally (if needed).

### Explanation:

Version control was implemented using Git and GitHub. The project was initialized locally, connected to a remote GitHub repository, and updated using a clear commit history. Screenshots were taken to document each step and GitHub was used to track all progress.
