## GitHub Issues & Collaboration Simulation

This folder demonstrates how GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are used to simulate collaborative software development.

### Simulated Issue:
- Title: Bug - the dice does not role right
- Description: The `roll()` method wasn't rolling correctly
- Assignee: Me (Tereza Jelínková)
- Status: Resolved and closed

### Steps Taken:

1. Created a new branch: `bugfix-dice-roll`
2. Fixed the bug: Updated `roll()` method to loop through each die and roll it only if it was not locked.
3. Committed the fix: `git commit -m "Fix dice rolling bug"`
4. Pushed the branch to GitHub: `git push origin bugfix-dice-roll`
5. Opened a Pull Request: From `bugfix-dice-roll` into `master`
6. Reviewed and merged the PR (simulated a team review)

### Documentation:

A classmate was supposed to review the code and report an issue. Due to unavailability, the issue was self-created, self-resolved and documented by me.

### Notes:

This part shows understanding of:
- creating + tracking issues
- fixing bugs and documenting the process
