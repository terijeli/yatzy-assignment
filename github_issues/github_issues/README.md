## GitHub Issues & Collaboration Simulation

This folder demonstrates how GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are used to simulate collaborative software development.

### Simulated Issue:
- **Title**: Bug: Dice not rolling correctly
- **Description**: The `roll()` method wasn't rolling all unlocked dice correctly.
- **Assignee**: Me (Tereza Jelínková)
- **Status**: Resolved and closed

### Steps Taken:

1. **Created a new branch**: `bugfix-dice-roll`
2. **Fixed the bug**: Updated `roll()` method to loop through each die and roll it only if it was not locked.
3. **Committed the fix**: `git commit -m "Fix dice rolling bug"`
4. **Pushed the branch to GitHub**: `git push origin bugfix-dice-roll`
5. **Opened a Pull Request**: From `bugfix-dice-roll` into `master`
6. **Reviewed and merged** the PR (simulated a team review)

### Documentation:

A classmate (or simulated user) was supposed to review the code and report an issue. Since no real partner was available, the issue was self-created and documented to simulate a collaborative process.

### Screenshots:

- Screenshot of the GitHub Issue
- Screenshot of the Pull Request
- Screenshot of the merge
- Comments pretending to simulate feedback

### Notes:

This simulation shows understanding of:
- Creating and tracking issues
- Creating and merging branches
- Fixing bugs and documenting the process
